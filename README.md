We are a multidisciplinary group of researchers affiliated with Albert Einstein College of Medicine, The City University of New York, and Columbia University, and are are interested in using System Dynamics methods to model and simulate opioid use in the 16 communities (counties) involved in the [New York HEALing Communities Study](https://hcs.columbia.edu).

# System Dynamics Model Interactive Portal

Our portal is the primary way that NY-HCS communities can interact with the System Dynamics model that we have developed. Each community accesses the portal with a unique PIN.  Please reach out if you do not have a PIN or have forgotten yours.

# Systems Think Tank Consultation Request

Whether you need help navigating and using the interactive portal or would like someone to help brainstorm creative ways to use our System Dynamics model to inform your community's Phase 4 Action Planning process and the development of your SMART strategies, we are eager to help you!  Please reach out to us to schedule a consultation, and someone from our team will be in touch soon.
